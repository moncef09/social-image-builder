# Social Media Image Builder

This project is a small demo of how generative AI can streamline content creation for social media. It allows you to describe a post, choose the mood and style, select background images, and then upload your product photo. Behind the scenes, a Node.js server orchestrates calls to Google Gemini to extract key elements, generate prompts and create a final composite image.

## ✨ Features

- **Agentic user flow** – The app asks two short follow‑up questions about mood and style using a simple state machine. These answers help tailor the backgrounds and final composition, making the experience feel interactive and personal.
- **Automatic element extraction** – Leveraging the Gemini API, the backend breaks your description down into search terms for finding relevant background images.
- **Image search & selection** – The frontend uses the Google Custom Search API to fetch candidate background images. You can pick or skip images for each element.
- **AI‑generated composite** – Once you’ve selected backgrounds and uploaded a product photo, the server constructs a single detailed prompt and uses the Gemini image model to generate a photorealistic composition. The product’s appearance is preserved while the background reflects your chosen mood and style.
- **Modern, responsive UI** – Built with vanilla JavaScript and custom CSS, the interface uses a step‑by‑step layout, chat bubbles for the agentic questions, and clear calls to action.

## 🛠 Technology

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS and JavaScript (no frameworks). The interface is structured into clear steps and uses flexbox/grid for layout.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express. It manages the agentic flow, calls the Google Generative AI SDK, and serves as an API for the frontend.
- **AI services:** Google Gemini 1.5/2.5 models for text and image generation.
- **Search:** Google Custom Search API for retrieving background photos.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moncef09/social-image-builder.git
   cd social-image-builder
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root with your API key:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the backend**
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
   The server listens on port 3000 by default.

5. **Open the frontend** by loading `index.html` in your browser. You can also serve it via a simple web server (e.g., `npx http-server`).

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Describe your post** – Enter a short description like “a cozy coffee shop on a rainy day with a warm latte”.
2. **Answer the agent’s questions** – The app asks about mood (e.g., cozy, energetic) and style (e.g., pastel colors, black‑and‑white) to guide the search and composition.
3. **Select backgrounds** – For each extracted element (e.g., coffee shop interior, rainy window), pick an image you like or skip if none appeal.
4. **Upload your product** – Provide a photo of the product you want to feature (e.g., a mug). The server analyses it to include key details.
5. **Generate** – The backend assembles your inputs into a single prompt and sends it to the Gemini image model. You receive a polished, photorealistic composite.
